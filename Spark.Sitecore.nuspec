	<summary>A Sitecore extension library used by the Spark namespace.</summary>
	<description>
		Spark contains a number of very useful Sitecore utilities They include:
		
		A Datasource Resolver that automatically escapes XPath statements for use by "query" and "fast"
		
		A rule and event framework that allows programmers to explicitly specify required conditions for parameters that are typically not specified in the pipeline, such as database, site, and language.
		
		Extensions to Language that make it easier to transition between ISO-codes, Language Items and Globalization.Language objects.
		
		A handful of Rules for automatically moving Items to appropriate subfolders to create blog-like URLs.
